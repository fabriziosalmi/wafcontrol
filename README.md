# üåê WAFcontrol (Cloudflare WAF Settings Automation)

Welcome to **WAFcontrol**, a streamlined solution for managing Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) security settings across multiple zones. This tool allows you to manage various security settings for individual domains through a simple YAML configuration.

## üöÄ Project Summary

**WAFcontrol** provides a centralized and automated solution to manage security settings for multiple Cloudflare domains using a YAML configuration file. You can define default security settings and customize them for individual domains, all managed through GitHub Actions automation.

## ‚ú® Features Overview

### Core Features
- **Multi-Zone Support**: Manage security settings across multiple domains using a unified configuration.
- **Declarative YAML Configuration**: Simplify security management with a human-readable YAML file.
- **Free Plan Compatibility**: Works with Cloudflare's free plan.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Built-in automation support.

### Security Features Managed
- **Security Level Control**: Set security levels for each zone.
    - Available options: `off`, `essentially_off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `under_attack`.
- **Challenge Passage**: Configure how Cloudflare responds to potential threats.
    - Available options: `default`, `bypass`, `challenge`.
- **Browser Integrity Check**: Enable or disable browser integrity checks.
    - Available options: `on`, `off`.
- **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites**: Enable or disable automatic HTTPS rewrites.
    - Available options: `on`, `off`.
- **Default Settings**: Define default security settings that apply to all zones.
- **Zone-Specific Overrides**: Customize security settings for individual domains.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Configuration**: Define security settings in a YAML file, with common settings under `default` and zone-specific overrides.
2.  **Execution**: The script applies the settings using Cloudflare's API and logs the results.
3.  **Automation**: Runs automatically through GitHub Actions on schedule or manual trigger.

## üìÑ YAML Configuration Example

```yaml
cloudflare:
  waf:
    default:
      firewall_settings:
        security_level: "high"
        challenge_passage: "default"
        browser_integrity_check: "on"
        automatic_https_rewrites: "on"
    zones:
      - id: "your-zone-id"
        domain: "your-domain.com"
        waf:
          firewall_settings:
            security_level: "under_attack"
            challenge_passage: "bypass" #override default
            browser_integrity_check: "off" #override default
            automatic_https_rewrites: "on" #no override
```

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Cloudflare Account with API token.
- GitHub repository.
- Python 3.9 or higher.

Required API token permissions:
- Zone Settings: Edit

### 2. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/wafcontrol.git
cd wafcontrol
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic requests PyYAML tenacity
```

### 3. Configuration

1. Create Cloudflare API token:
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí API Tokens
   - Create a token with `Zone Settings:Edit` permission
   - Add token to GitHub repository secrets as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

2. Configure your zones:
   - Edit `config/cloudflare.yaml` with your zone IDs and domains.
   - Set desired security settings for each zone, you can use the default section and override settings for each zone.

### 4. GitHub Actions Setup

The workflow runs automatically:
- On push to the `main` branch (affecting relevant files).
- Daily at midnight UTC.
- Manual trigger through GitHub Actions UI.

Workflow file `.github/workflows/waf-control.yml`:
```yaml
name: WAF Control

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'config/**'
      - 'scripts/**'
      - '.github/workflows/**'
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    
    env:
      CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
        cache: 'pip'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pydantic requests PyYAML tenacity
    
    - name: Apply WAF settings
      run: python scripts/apply_cloudflare.py --config config/cloudflare.yaml
```

## üìä Example Output

```plaintext
::INFO :: Cloudflare API token is valid.
::INFO :: Processing zone example.com (zone-id)...
::INFO :: Applying WAF settings for zone zone-id...
::INFO :: Successfully updated security level to under_attack
::INFO :: Successfully updated challenge passage to bypass
::INFO :: Successfully updated browser integrity check to off
::INFO :: Successfully updated automatic https rewrites to on
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Never commit API tokens to the repository.
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information.
- Use environment protection rules for production deployments.
- Double-check zone IDs and domains before deployment.

## üîß Supported Zones

You can apply the security settings to any Cloudflare zone, including free domains. The security settings control works with all Cloudflare plans.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1.  **API Token Issues**:
    - Ensure the token has `Zone Settings:Edit` permission.
    - Verify the token is correctly added to GitHub Secrets.
    - Check the token is not expired.

2.  **Configuration Issues**:
    - Verify zone IDs are correct.
    - Ensure YAML syntax is valid.
    - Check security level, challenge passage, browser integrity check, and automatic HTTPS rewrites values are valid options.
